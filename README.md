    var itemTransaction = MinsatToDDL.Lib.MinsatToDDL.Parse(MinsatToDDL.Console.Properties.Resources.MinsatSampleFile);
    
    // Define JSON serialization options
    var serializeOptions = new JsonSerializerSettings
    {
        NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore,
    };
    
    // Serialize the item transaction object to JSON format
    var serializeJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(itemTransaction, Formatting.Indented, serializeOptions);
